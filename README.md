This is a presentation based off of [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js).

## Overview

Let's chat about the next iteration of Drupal!

This session will be a brief overview of Drupal 8 for site builders, developers, and the community while also allowing enough time for questions and discussion.

We'll do a short demo of Drupal 8 and highlight some new features and differences, an overview of technical concepts that are introduced, and how everyone can help move the newest version of Drupal along to a stable release candidate.
